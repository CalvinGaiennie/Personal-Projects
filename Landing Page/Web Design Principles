A website is made up of rows
every row is a distinct function and idea
every row is visually distinct
backround should never be the same twice in a row
a row can have mutiple rows inside it if they are all about the same main idea
its not about seperating the rows its about seperating the ideas
white then light grey is fine
primary colors of the websites color scheme as row backrounds is fine.
each row should have some vertical padidng on it 50-80 px
you need the content first then pick a layout
