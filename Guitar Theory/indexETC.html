      <h1>Ear Trainer</h1>
      <h3>What is the point of this?</h3>
      <p>
        While developing my ears I have tried out many different ear training
        methods, apps, and classes. What I ended up doing is saying fuck all of
        that and spending most of my time trying to learn songs by ear just by
        sitting with a guitar and listening to them over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest problem was that I struggled to find songs of the appropriate
        difficulty. Especially in the beggining. Because of this I decided to
        put together a database of demos sorted by density of mix and complexity
        of chord progression.
