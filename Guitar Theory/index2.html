              <h2>Learn the Notes on The E and A Strings First</h2>
              <p>Learning the notes on the E and A string will be very useful when using barre chords, power chords, and scales. Also with the octive trick I am going to show you later you can know the name of any note on the fretboard instintaniously if you know the notes on the E and A string.</p>

              <h2>
                Barre Chords and the Caged System
              </h2>
              <p>The Caged System is simply getting the most out of barre chords.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="octive-trick">
              <h2>
                Standard tuning octive hack to not have to learn the whole fretboard.
              </h2>
              <p>
                The most beautiful thing about the guitar is that it is shape
                based. You can often learn one shape for something and use it in every key and multiple octives. An example of this would be barre chords(I'll explain that later.)
              </p>
              <p>
                These two shapes actually create the same interval, an octive, we will
                get into what that is and how it works later but for now all you need to
                know is that if you play the shape from the top two photos from the
                6-4th strings or from the 5-3rd strings both notes you are playing will
                be the same note, one will be an octive higher but they will be the same
                note.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only difference between this shape and the next shape is that the
                second shape requires you to move your second finger one fret further.
              </p>
              <img src="./Photos/OG.png" />
              <p>
                Knowing these two shapes allows you to quickly find the name of any note
                on the fretboard simply by knowing the notes on the Low E string and the
                A string.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you want know the notes on the Low E string you also know all of the
                notes on the high E string becasue they are both tuned to E. So whatever
                the note on the fifth fret of the low E string is (A) it will be the
                same on the fifth fret of the high E string.
              </p>
              <p>
                So great I memorized two string worth of notes and now I know three
                strings worth of notes. Fun trick. What about the other three strings?
              </p>
              <p>These octive shapes give us another easy trick.</p>
              <p>
                If you want to know the name of a note on a string other than the E or A
                string you can use the octive shape to trace it back to the E or A
                string which you do know.
              </p>
              <p>
                For examample: if you wanted know all the notes on the Low E string and
                you wanted to know what note is on the third fret of the D string you
                could simply put make the first octive shape with your second finger on
                the third fret of the D string and whatver note your first finger is on
                is the same note. So in this case your first finger is on the first fret
                of the Low E string which is an F so the third fret of the D string must
                be an F.
