      <h3>What is my main goal for this lesson?</h3>
      <p>
        To give a breif overveiw of the basic music theory that is actually
        applicable to intermediate guitar players across all genres.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>I am not interested in teaching you how to do everything step by step. </p>
      <p>I simply want to explain what concepts I beleive are essential, give a couple pointers on how I would approach learning them, and point you to my favorite teachers/players who have already explained them in depth and showed a ton of examples.</p> -->
      <br />
      <h3>What skills will you get out of this?</h3>
      <p>• Play rythym parts anywhere on the fretboard.</p>
      <p>
        • Have multiple approaches to improvising/playing lead parts and know
        when to use them.
      </p>
      <p>• Understand what other players are doing.</p>
      <p>
        • Be able to understand and easily communicate with other musicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        (My definition of music theory is the language musicians use to explain
        music to each other. It's not a group of laws you must follow its more
        general guidlines and the language nessesary to explain them.)

      <h2>Naming Strings</h2>
      <p>
        If you dont know the string names you are probably not an intermediate
        guitar player and should probably hit up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNSaXAe8tyg&list=PLP3kvqg_Ut85O11T56_oBq-2qyfja8NWe">Marty Shwarts's beginner series</a> or something but there are a couple things I would like to clear up
        about string names and how we talk about the fretboard.
      </p>
      <h3 id="strings">String Numbers</h3>
      <p>Guitar strings can also be referred to by numbers. The strings are numbered from the high e to the low e with the high e (thinnest string) being string one, the b string being string 2, ect.
      </p>
      <h3>What do up and down mean in music?</h3>
      <p>Up means up in pitch down means down in pitch. If I say go up a string I mean go to the string that makes higher sounds (the thinner ones closer to the floor). This seems petty but its a good habit to be in especially when talking to people that play other instruments<p/>
      <!-- <p>If you are describing a lick to a trumpet player that goes up in pitch and you say that it goes down because your fingers are moving closer to the floor, you will be confusing and sound dumb. </p> -->
      <img src="SNum.jpeg" />
      <img src="SNum2.png" />
      <!-- <p>
        Every sound has a name. We name the guitar strings after the sound that
        we tune them to.<p/>

    <br />
    <div>
      <h2 id="notes" class="bold">The Notes in Music.</h2>
      <p>
        There are 12 notes in western music. (There can be more in eastern music such as Indian music but dont worry about that right now)
        <br />
        A, <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">A#</span>, B, C,
        <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">C#</span>, D,
        <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">D#</span>, E, F,
        <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">F#</span>, G,
        <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">G#</span> (# stands for
        sharp)
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice there is no sharp between B and C and no sharp between E and F.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        The notes that have #'s (sharps) in them can also be referred to as b's
        (flats) but we will get into that later, for now just think of them as
        #s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every fret on the fretboard makes the sound of one of these 12 notes. We
        name each location on the fretboard (each fret on each string) by the
        sound that it makes. For example every green circle in the photo below
        makes a G sound. Many are in different octives but they all make a G.
        Take a look at this diagram and notice how all 12 notes are there. After
        that grab your guitar and a tuner, play some notes and see if they
        coorespond to this diagram. (If your guitar is tuned than they will)
      </p>
      <img src="FN.jpg" />
      <img src="LEN.jpg" />
      <p>
        Each string makes the sound of its name when you play it without a
        finger on the fretboard. If you put a finger on a fret it makes that
        sound. For example if you play the low E string open it makes an E sound, if you put your finger on the third fret of the low E
        string and pick that string it makes a G sound.
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

      <h2>
        Standard tuning octive hack to not have to learn the whole fretboard. I
        should hide this section and make them press a button if they want the
        technique tips.
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most beautiful thing about the guitar is that it is shape
        based. You can often learn one shape for something and use it in every key and multiple octives. An example of this would be barre chords(I'll explain that later.)
      </p>
      <p>
        These two shapes actually create the same interval, an octive, we will
        get into what that is and how it works later but for now all you need to
        know is that if you play the shape from the top two photos from the
        6-4th strings or from the 5-3rd strings both notes you are playing will
        be the same note, one will be an octive higher but they will be the same
        note.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only difference between this shape and the next shape is that the
        second shape requires you to move your second finger one fret further.
      </p>
      <img src="OG.png" />
      <p>
        Knowing these two shapes allows you to quickly find the name of any note
        on the fretboard simply by knowing the notes on the Low E string and the
        A string.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want know the notes on the Low E string you also know all of the
        notes on the high E string becasue they are both tuned to E. So whatever
        the note on the fifth fret of the low E string is (A) it will be the
        same on the fifth fret of the high E string.
      </p>
      <p>
        So great I memorized two string worth of notes and now I know three
        strings worth of notes. Fun trick. What about the other three strings?
      </p>
      <p>These octive shapes give us another easy trick.</p>
      <p>
        If you want to know the name of a note on a string other than the E or A
        string you can use the octive shape to trace it back to the E or A
        string which you do know.
      </p>
      <p>
        For examample: if you wanted know all the notes on the Low E string and
        you wanted to know what note is on the third fret of the D string you
        could simply put make the first octive shape with your second finger on
        the third fret of the D string and whatver note your first finger is on
        is the same note. So in this case your first finger is on the first fret
        of the Low E string which is an F so the third fret of the D string must
        be an F.

      <h2 id="majorScale" class="bold">The Major Scale</h2>
      <p>
        A scale is a formula that helps us group notes together. The Major scale
        is the scale (group of notes) that all of western music is based on.
        Pretty much all music theory traces it's roots back to the major scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning the major scale will make it possible for you to easily figure
        out what key a song is in, know what chords are in a key, what notes are
        in a chord, what notes are in a scale as well as many other things.
      </p>
      <p>Understanding the major scale is essential for understanding basic music theory and therefor is essential for communicating with other musicians.</p>
      <p>If you're on stage at a blues jam and you're lost and the bass player holds up four fingers to you be better hope you know that he is telling you that the song is currently on the four chord and that because you are in the key of Bb the four chord is is Eb. BTW because guitar is shape based if you know what youre doing you dont even really need to know what the four chord is, only what key youre in and that you should be playing the four chord.</p>
      <p>
        The major scale is a seven note scale based on two different intervals (distances in music)
        half steps and whole steps, a half step is equal to one note. This means
        when you move over a half step you move over one fret (one note) and
        when you move over a whole step you move over two frets(two notes).
      </p>
      <p>Photo showing this</p>
      <p>
        So I said a scale is a formula right? Well what is the formula for the
        Major scale?
      </p>
      <p>The major scale Forumla is: W, W, H, W, W, W, H</p>
      <p>
        Here is an example. Photo and examples written out showing all the notes
        and how major scales are derrived from them.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a diagram of one octive of the major scale on a guitar.</p>

      <h2 id="chords">How to make major and minor chords.</h2>
      <h3>
        How to make a major chord?
      </h3>
      <p>To make a major chord you need three notes, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the corresponding Major Scale.
        For example the key of C is C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. <br>
        So a C major Chord contains C E and G.</p>
      <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a C Chord-->
      <p>An A major scale is A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G# <br>
      So an A Major Chord contains A, C#, and E</p>
      <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a A Chord-->
      <h3>How to make a minor chord.</h3>
      <p>To make a minor chord you do the same thing and flatten the third</p>
      <p>So if an A major scale is A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G# <br>
      An A Minor Chord contains A, C and E and a C minor Chord contains C Eb and G</p>
      <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a C minor Chord-->
      <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a C Major Chord-->
      <p>Then show triads or the caged system to show how many different ways you can make a C chord and an A chord and an A minor chord</p>
      <p>The caged system is just barre chords and its awesome</p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 id="key">What are the chords in a key and how to find them.</h2>
      <p>If you want the simple answer here is it.</p>
      <p>Take a major scale. Turn the 1st, 4th, and 5th, note into major chords, the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th notes minor chords, and the 7th note a diminished chord. <button class="'diminished">WTF is a diminshed chord?</button></p>
      <p>Example: the C major scale is C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.</p>
      <p>The key of C major is C, Dminor, Eminor, F, G, Aminor and B diminished (when talking about chords if the quality is not specificed it is assumed that the chord is major, so if someone says D chord they mean a D major chord. Also diminished chords are signified with the degree symbol ° but diminished chords are rarely used so you dont really need to worry much about them.)</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to know why this is then here we go. 
        Insert charts explaining all the notes in all the chords in a few keys ideally with an interactive diagram that walks you through it.
