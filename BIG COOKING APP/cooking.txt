Overview
I want to build a cooking app
Each recipe will be written out very simply showing an ingredient list, a list of steps, list of equipment, and built in timers.


Resources
• Built in recipes with timers, dynamic serving/ingredient ammounts
• reference page with measurement converstions, protein temps, and other basic info
• an automatic measurement converter
• a section listing and teaching basic cooking skills: ex put some beans in a skillet and practice skillet tossing


What is the database for
• allowing users to save their own recipes
