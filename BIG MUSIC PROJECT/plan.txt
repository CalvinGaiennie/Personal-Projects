Overview
I want to create 1 large full stack project showing off and challenging my programming skills.
I am planning on building an app containing resources musicians.


List of Resources
• list / lecture on what a begginer guitarist needs to know.
•intermediate guitar theory lecture.
• chord/ scale generator: including scales and arpeggios by shape, triad shapes, barre chords, and open chords.
•metronome
•stick control workouts
•chord chart generator
•tab generator
•drum notation generator
•Ear trainer by progressions 
•Ear trainer bass
•Ear trainer keys
•Ear trainer melodies


What is the database needed for?
• let users build their own rudiment workouts
• store user created tabs and drum notation
• collect user suggestions on how to improve the app. (if the app is live hosted somewhere where these can be sent to me)
