        <p>Step 1: Start a pot of water boiling for the noodles.</p>
        <p>Step 2: Whisk together the ingredients for the sauce.</p>
        <p>
          Step 3: Cut the beef, season it, then mix the flour and oil with it in
          a bowl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 4: When the water is boiling, add ({1} tablespoon) of salt, and
          the noodles. Cook until tender, about three minutes. Reserve 1/2 a cup
          of pasta water, drain the noodles, rince them under cold water, then
          set them aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 5: In a large deep skillet, heat the avacoado oil over
          medium-high heat. Add the steak in a single layer and cook until
          golden brown on all sides and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
          Transfer to a clean plate and set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 6: Make sure the skillet is still well oiled then add in the
          brocoli and cook it. Toss it until it's slightly tender, 2-3 minutes.
          Add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water and partially steam the
          brocoli, uncovered until it turns bright green and the liquid has
          evaporated, about two more minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 7: Add the beef back to the skillet and pour in the sauce and
          remaining {.25} cups of pasta water, and toss constantly until the
          noodles are coated and the sauce has started to thicken, about 2 more
          minutes.
        </p>
        <p>Step 8: Serve</p>
